```bash
# Enable AI mode
export EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_MODE=true
npm run start:ai

# Or use AI-specific commands
npm run ios:ai      # iOS with AI enabled
npm run android:ai  # Android with AI enabled
```

# Generate all report formats with verbose output
npm run balance:test:all

# Quick test for development (3 runs, levels 1-2)
npm run balance:test:quick

# See test plan without execution
npm run balance:test:dry
```

### AI Player Integration
